client server model:
Sever-> central location_>multiple clients(devices, computers)
Fortnight(central server)
-> connected to central server(faster than each client)
-> connected to other client server(slower)
->info transferred from c1 to server, info passed to other clients
IN local network
Modem: connected to internet has one public ip address (physical address) 
->devices connected to router(devices are connected) wirelessly, has a local ip address 
-> client, each device is shared with a Ip address(IPV4), local client ip address is visible to the clients connected to the same router

--> Pick the port
--> Pick the server
--> Bind the socket to the ip address (which ip to accept, standard way to send data)
--> AF_INET- family of ipv4
--> Sock_stream – establishment of connection to TCP default connection
